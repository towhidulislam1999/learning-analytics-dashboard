# Learning Analytics Dashboard

## üìä Project Introduction

The **Learning Analytics Dashboard** is a comprehensive web-based application designed to provide educators and administrators with powerful insights into student performance and learning patterns. This project combines interactive data visualization with Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities to analyze student data, generate detailed reports, and identify trends that can help improve educational outcomes.

The dashboard offers both a standalone HTML interface and a Python backend integration, making it flexible for various deployment scenarios. Whether you're an educator looking to understand your students' performance or a data analyst exploring educational data, this tool provides an intuitive and powerful solution.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally (HTML Dashboard)

The simplest way to get started is using the standalone HTML dashboard:

### **Step 1: Download the Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/towhidulislam1999/learning-analytics-dashboard.git
cd learning-analytics-dashboard
```

### **Step 2: Open the Dashboard**
- Navigate to the project folder
- Locate the `index.html` file
- Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default web browser
- Alternatively, right-click and select "Open with" to choose a specific browser

### **Step 3: Upload Your Data**
- Click on the "Upload Data" button in the dashboard
- Select your CSV or Excel file containing student data
- The dashboard will automatically process and display the analytics

**Note**: The HTML dashboard works entirely in your browser without requiring any server setup. However, some advanced features require the Python backend.

## üêç How to Use with Python Backend

For advanced features including NLP analysis, use the Python backend:

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### **Option A: Using Streamlit**

#### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
```

#### **Step 2: Download Required NLTK Data**
```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"
```

#### **Step 3: Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

#### **Step 4: Access the Dashboard**
- The app will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
- If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to the URL manually

#### **Step 5: Upload Sample Data**
- Use the file uploader in the sidebar
- Sample file path: `./data/student_data.csv`
- Or create your own CSV with columns: `student_id`, `name`, `grade`, `attendance`, `participation`

### **Option B: Using Flask**

#### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
```

#### **Step 2: Run the Flask Server**
```bash
python flask_app.py
```

#### **Step 3: Access the Application**
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
- The dashboard interface will load with all features enabled
